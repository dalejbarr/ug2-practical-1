# Combining ANOVA and Regression

## Overview

Over the last few weeks of the semester we have been really building up our skills on regression and on ANOVAs and seeing the link between them. Most places would tell you that they are separate entitites but you as will see from the reading and activities of this lab, they are all related. ANOVAs to some degree are just a special type of regression where you have categorical predictors.  The question you probably now have is, well, if they are related, can't we merge them and combine categorical and continuous predictors in some fashion?  Yes, yes we can! And that is exactly what we are going to do to today whilst learning a little bit about screen time and well-being (or wellbeing depending on your preference).

The goals of this chapter are:

1. to gain a conceptual understanding of how ANOVA and regression are interlinked.
2. to get practical experience in analysing continuous and categorical variables in the one design.
3. to consolidate the wrangling skills we have learnt over the past two years.
